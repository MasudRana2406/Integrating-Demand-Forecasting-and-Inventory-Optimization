## 🎯 Project Overview

This project predicts **future product sales** using deep learning (LSTM) on the **M5 Forecasting – Walmart Sales** dataset.
The model helps retailers **plan inventory**, **reduce stockouts**, and **improve service levels** — transforming sales history into actionable insights.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Information

**Source:** [Kaggle – M5 Forecasting Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy)

**Files used:**

* `sales_train_validation.csv` → Historical daily sales for each item and store
* `calendar.csv` → Date mapping and events (used for aligning sales timeline)

**Data size:**

* 30,490 products × 1,913 days of daily sales
* Period: *January 2011 – May 2016*

---

## 🧠 Business Objective

To forecast **future daily sales** for any product or store and assist decision-makers in:

* Determining optimal **inventory levels**
* Planning **production or replenishment**
* Reducing **holding costs** and **lost-sales risk**

## ⚙️ Methodology

| Step                           | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Data Loading & Cleaning** | Read `sales_train_validation.csv` and `calendar.csv`, align 1913 daily records with calendar dates. |
| **2. Product Selection**       | Dynamically identify product and store (e.g., `HOBBIES_1_001_CA_1`).                                |
| **3. Data Preprocessing**      | Scale sales data to [0,1] range and create rolling time windows (past 30 days → next day).          |
| **4. Model Building**          | Two-layer **LSTM network** with dropout for regularization.                                         |
| **5. Evaluation**              | Compare actual vs predicted sales on the last 20% of data.                                          |
| **6. Forecasting**             | Predict next 30 days and visualize the future trend.                                                |

## 📈 Results

### Sample Product Forecast

**Observation:**

* The model effectively captures seasonal and weekly patterns.
* Forecasted sales follow realistic retail fluctuations — useful for inventory and supply-chain decisions.

## 📊 Next 30-Day Forecast (Example)

| Date       | Predicted Sales |
| ---------- | --------------: |
| 2016-05-23 |           212.7 |
| 2016-05-24 |           219.4 |
| 2016-05-25 |           225.8 |
| ...        |             ... |

*(Saved automatically as `forecast_next_30_days.csv`)*

## 🔍 Key Learnings

* Proper **date alignment** between `calendar.csv` and sales columns (`d_1`–`d_1913`) is crucial.
* LSTM models can generalize sales patterns from raw transactional data without explicit time features.
* A small change (window size, dropout, learning rate) can significantly impact forecasting stability.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

| Enhancement                   | Goal                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Add `sell_prices.csv`         | Include price sensitivity and promotion effects. |
| Integrate event/holiday flags | Capture spikes during promotions or holidays.    |
| Compare with classical models | Evaluate ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost baselines.  |
